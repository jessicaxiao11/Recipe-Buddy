# Recipe-Buddy
(Final project for PUI)

Recipe Buddy allows users to interact with static website recipes (for now, just on damndelicious.net) and add them to your weekly planner. Users can check off ingredients, view instructions in a slide deck, and organize their recipes in a weekly planner.

## Installation Instructions

5. Done! The extension should appear with the rest of your other extensions.
